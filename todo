//Check vid updates still working after overhaul!

//Swap SQL over to struct methods

//Remove Channel Struct from YTclient, swap all logic to use sql directly rather than awkward middle man

//form github repo

implement better logging across the board, implement better recovery now that we know the base logic is working
-foxeye.go done, need to implement across clients, need to pass logger context, need command flag to set verbose level

add proper comments for exported functions

//decouple sql client from ytclient. It shouldnt need to know any DB stuff, just execute queries and return, let the higher level logic decide what to do with It
//-yt functions outside setup should all return useable data. Everything that calls it should expect to use that data
//-main foxeye.go should ONLY have construction, logic should be passed off 
-discord commands should get own file
//-discord can see yt and sql. 

//hierarchy should be as so:

                                            foxeye(initialize/deal with configuration)
